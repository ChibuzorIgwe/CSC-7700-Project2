# CSC-7700-Project2
This repository contains Pytorch implementations of RNN, LSTM, and Transformer Models for Large Language Modeling and text generation. It includes training, evaluation (perplexity &amp; BLEU score), and prompt-based response generation. Transformer significantly outperforms others.
